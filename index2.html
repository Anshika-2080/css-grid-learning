          current, if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I

          looking to make a transition and have heard some pople who had an
          amazing experience here. I signed up for the free intro course and
          found it incredeibly fun! I enrolled shortly thereafter, The next 12
          weeks was the best-and most gruneling-time of my life. Since
          completing the course, I've successfully seitched careeres, working as
          a Software Engineer at a startup."

          "Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of code. I
          needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
          programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former
          student of theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program.
          The entire curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very
          hands-on and I never had to wait long for assistance. The agile team
          project, in particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the
          next level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
          often referred to it during interviews as an example of my developent
          experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a full-stack
          developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend!"
